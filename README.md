# HTML CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Capstone project

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

- It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
- You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.

## Project specifications

The project you are going to build for the HTML & CSS Capstone Project is based on an online website for a conference. You should follow the given design of the website, but you must personalise the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course. It's very important the you personalise your project, so that you have something unique in your portfolio to share with potential employers during your job search.

Whatever the content for the event you may choose, you should build these 3 pages as the minimum requirements:

- the main page, with a menu link to the about page and tickets page
- the about page
- the tickets page

 

Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes: 

- mobile: up to 768px
- desktop: from 768px

You should follow the guidelines of the given design, including:

- colors
- typographies: font face, size and weight
- layout: composition and space between elements, for the 2 given screen sizes

I managed to do the main page, about page and Tickets page of an Nvidia conference about the newest technologies,
I used bootstrap on many sections while also implenting css on more specific parts of the program.
